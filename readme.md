🌊 Sonar Data Prediction Model 🚀
Welcome to the Sonar Data Prediction Model project! This project predicts whether an object detected by sonar equipment is a rock or a mine based on sonar readings. Using a Logistic Regression model, we analyze sonar data and predict the type of object detected. 🔍

🎯 Project Overview
This project utilizes the Sonar Data dataset, which consists of sonar readings from a sonar sensor. The goal is to classify the readings as either a rock or a mine. The dataset contains 60 attributes, and we use Logistic Regression to classify the data with high accuracy.

🧑‍💻 Getting Started
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:


pip install -r requirements.txt

Required Libraries:
pandas - Data manipulation and analysis.
numpy - Working with arrays and matrices.
matplotlib - Plotting library.
scikit-learn - Machine learning algorithms and tools.

📊 The Dataset
This project uses a dataset where each row represents a sonar scan of an object. It includes 60 features (sonar readings) and a label in the 61st column (M for mine and R for rock).

Data Characteristics:
Mines: 111 instances
Rocks: 97 instances

🔧 Model Building
Steps Involved:
Data Preprocessing: We start by splitting the data into features (X) and labels (y). Then, the data is split into training and test sets.
Model Training: We use Logistic Regression to train the model on the training data.
Model Evaluation: We evaluate the model’s accuracy on both the training and test datasets.

🎯 How to Use
To use the model for prediction, you can provide a new sonar reading, and the model will predict whether it's a Mine or Rock. Here's an example code:

input_data = (0.0303, 0.0353, 0.0490, 0.0608, 0.0167, 0.1354, 0.1465, 0.1123, 0.1945, 0.2354, 0.2898, 0.2812, 0.1578, 0.0273, 0.0673, 0.1444, 0.2070, 0.2645, 0.2828, 0.4293, 0.5685, 0.6990, 0.7246, 0.7622, 0.9242, 1.0000, 0.9979, 0.8297, 0.7032, 0.7141, 0.6893, 0.4961, 0.2584, 0.0969, 0.0776, 0.0364, 0.1572, 0.1823, 0.1349, 0.0849, 0.0492, 0.1367, 0.1552, 0.1548, 0.1319, 0.0985, 0.1258, 0.0954, 0.0489, 0.0241, 0.0042, 0.0086, 0.0046, 0.0126, 0.0036, 0.0035, 0.0034, 0.0079, 0.0036, 0.0048)

# Convert input to numpy array
input_data_as_numpy_array = np.asarray(input_data)

# Reshape the array for prediction
input_data_reshaped = input_data_as_numpy_array.reshape(1, -1)

# Predict using the trained model
prediction = lg_model.predict(input_data_reshaped)

if prediction[0] == "M":
    print("The Object Is A Mine")
else:
    print("The Object Is A Rock")

📊 Model Evaluation
We evaluated the model on both training data and testing data, and here's how it performs:

## Accuracy on Training Data:
Accuracy: 83.42 %

## Accuracy on Testing Data:
Accuracy: 76.19 %

🚧 Future Enhancements
There’s always room for improvement! Here’s what we could add next:

Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different model configurations to improve accuracy.
Visualizations: Add confusion matrices and other plots to better understand model performance.
Deploy as an Application: We can deploy this model as a web application using Flask or Streamlit for easy user interaction. 🌍
